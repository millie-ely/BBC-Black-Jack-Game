## Welcome to my BlackJack Game

Welcome to my attempt of the blackjack game in relation to the BBC software engineering graduate scheme assessment interview.

## Information of the set up

This Java repository contains four folders with the two main usages being :

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.

The src folder contains main folder which holds the games executable sources by using the fundamentals along with the models created for the user the App.java can start the game for the user/users. Also within this src is a test folder to hold a test case for important functionalities used within the game to make sure they produce expected outcomes that would make sense within the game scenario.

## Instructions

- Single or multi player game -> players are asked on initalisation. 
- The dealers first card will be made present to the players.
